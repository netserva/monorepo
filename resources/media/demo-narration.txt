Welcome to the NetServa podcast generator demonstration.

First, let's navigate to the media directory.

Let's see what files we have available.

Now we'll generate a podcast from a text file using mkpodcast.

The podcast has been generated successfully.

Let's check the output file.

That's how easy it is to create professional podcasts with NetServa.

Thank you for watching this demonstration.
