Session Journal for NetServa 3.0.

Session Journal is your lightweight context management system for Claude
Code development. It solves the context loss problem when you clear
conversations or start new sessions by capturing essential decisions,
changes, and next steps so you can resume work effortlessly without
re-explaining everything from scratch.

Quick Start.

Session Journal uses two slash commands. Use slash snapshot at the end
of each work session to capture what you did, why you did it, and what
comes next. Use slash resume at the start of your next session to load
that context and continue where you left off. That is the complete
workflow.

When to Use.

Use the full template for feature development, complex bug
investigations, architectural changes, or work spanning multiple files.
Use the quick template for simple fixes, documentation updates, or minor
tweaks. Skip journaling for trivial changes like typos or formatting.

What Gets Captured.

Every entry captures five elements. Session focus describes what you are
working on and why. Changes made lists specific files with line numbers.
Next steps provides actionable tasks. Key decisions documents why you
chose this approach. Pattern compliance ensures you followed NetServa
architectural standards.

NetServa Patterns.

The checklist catches violations early. Database-first means all config
in vconfs table, never files. SSH execution uses RemoteExecutionService
with heredoc pattern. CLI arguments are positional, not dash dash flags.
Testing requires Pest 4.0 with full coverage. Code style must pass
vendor slash bin slash pint. Filament uses version 4 syntax only. No
hardcoding paths, credentials, or hostnames.

Workflow Patterns.

Feature development starts with slash resume, work following patterns,
create tests as you code, document decisions, end with slash snapshot.
Bug investigation creates entry when discovered, documents symptoms,
tracks investigation, documents root cause and fix, notes gotchas.
Exploratory work creates entry, uses key decisions for findings,
technical notes for discoveries, next steps for planning. Multi-day
features use slash snapshot daily and slash resume to load context.

Essential Commands.

Create entries with slash snapshot. Resume context with slash resume.
View recent with ls dash lt dot claude slash journal slash star dot md
pipe head dash 5. Search topics with grep dash l quote topic quote dot
claude slash journal slash star dot md.

Best Practices.

Create entries at natural breakpoints like end of session or before
switching tasks. Use specific file references with line numbers.
Document why, not just what. Keep next steps actionable and prioritized.
Use pattern compliance checklist as quick self-review before finishing.

What to Avoid.

Don't wait until memory fades. Don't skip documenting obvious decisions.
Don't create journals for tiny changes. Don't copy templates without
customizing. Don't forget to link related sessions when working on
multi-day features.

Thank you for listening to Session Journal for NetServa 3.0.
